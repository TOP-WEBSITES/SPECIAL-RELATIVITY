However, there was no experimental backing to this idea, and there was nothing but a glorified hunch that prompted theorists to believe in this. </p><p data-v-501fa9a6>This paved the way for Michelson and Morley to develop an experimental set-up to demonstrate the existence of the aether.</p><figure data-v-501fa9a6><img src="'+F+'" id="fig:exp1" alt="Sketch of the Michelson-Morley Experiment" style="width:50%;height:50%;" data-v-501fa9a6><figcaption aria-hidden="true" data-v-501fa9a6><h4 data-v-501fa9a6> Sketch of the Michelson-Morley Experiment</h4></figcaption></figure><br data-v-501fa9a6><p data-v-501fa9a6> The experiment took place on a table that was spun.
