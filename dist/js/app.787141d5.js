The most prevalent of theories was that of a luminiferous aether, a mysterious substance that permeated space (sounds familiar to a certain dark matter), that mediated in the transmission of light, or electromagnetic waves. However, there was no experimental backing to this idea, and there was nothing but a glorified hunch that prompted theorists to believe in this. </p><p data-v-0c4c192c>This paved the way for Michelson and Morley to develop an experimental set-up to demonstrate the existence of the aether.</p><figure data-v-0c4c192c><img src="'+T+'" id="fig:exp1" alt="Sketch of the Michelson-Morley Experiment" data-v-0c4c192c><figcaption aria-hidden="true" data-v-0c4c192c><h4 data-v-0c4c192c> Sketch of the Michelson-Morley Experiment</h4></figcaption></figure><br data-v-0c4c192c><p data-v-0c4c192c> The experiment took place on a table that was spun. A ray of light was shone from one side to another, and was reflected through the mirror. This was done to determine the speed of light in perpendicular directions, and detect if there was any change, due to the relative speed to the aether wind, that was believed to affect the speed of light. This is similar to how wind can distort the propogation of sound, and how it is difficult to hear someone when it is very windy. </p><p data-v-0c4c192c> However, despite the preconceived notion of an omnipresent aether, the experiment yielded a famous <em data-v-0c4c192c>null</em> result, showing conclusively that light speed in a particular medium is constant, and that there is no evidence that aether permeated the environment.

Many of these have been logically resolved and therefore might technically not be considered true paradoxes. However, they are still very useful thought experiments to help one to wrap their head around the intricacies of special relativity, little brain teasers if you will, so here are some of the more prominent ones.</p><h2 data-v-4b398fd6> Twin Paradox </h2><p data-v-4b398fd6>Suppose there are two identical twins, and one travels on a rocket far away into space near the speed of light. When that twin returns, he finds that his sibling has aged more due to the effects of time dilation. However, since both twins see each other as moving away from them, shouldn’t the effects of time dilation apply to both of them, leading to both of them finding that the other has aged more?</p><p data-v-4b398fd6><img src="'+ct+'" style="width:5.96875in;height:3.82292in;" alt="THE TWINS PARADOX | Cool Knowledge" data-v-4b398fd6></p><p data-v-4b398fd6>This is an especially confounding conumdrum that requires difficult mental gymnastics to fully comprehend. The answer will be explained more completely in the video.</p><p data-v-4b398fd6>However, this is essentially a known consequence of Special Relativity. Due to the differences in frames between the two twins, there has to be a difference in how fast time travels between the two twins, and if there is a significant difference in speed between the two observers, then they must have aged at different paces.</p><p data-v-4b398fd6>In fact, this is noticeable in real-life with non-negligible figures. Meet Russian cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev.</p><p data-v-4b398fd6><img src="'+dt+'" style="width:3.01042in;height:3.82292in;" alt="ESA - Sergei Konstantinovich Krikalev" data-v-4b398fd6></p><p data-v-4b398fd6>Given the fact he has spent a mind-boggling 803 days in space, specifically in orbit around the earth, he has experienced a speed faster than all of us. This means, that the effects of time dilation apply and he has indeed ‘time-travelled’ approximately 0.02 seconds into the future. In other words, he has lived less than everyone else on the planet for about 0.02 seconds.</p><h2 data-v-4b398fd6>Ladder paradox a.k.a Barn-Pole Paradox</h2><p data-v-4b398fd6>Imagine if you will, a large pole say the length of 2u, and a barn with 2 doors, with the length of 1.6u, as in the figure below.</p><p data-v-4b398fd6><img src="'+ut+'" style="width:5in;height:2.25in;" data-v-4b398fd6></p><p data-v-4b398fd6>It is obvious that the pole could not possibly fit into the barn, right? Due to it simply being longer than the barn, the pole will stick out on one of the two ends.</p><p data-v-4b398fd6>What if, now the pole was moving through the barn. At non-relativistic speeds, this would still hold true; as the pole travels through the barn, part of it would be visible throughout. Now, let’s think about what if the pole was moving through the barn at relativistic speeds. Length contraction now becomes a significant consideration. (As a refresher, length contraction is the phenomenon of where the length of a moving object as measured by one frame of reference is different than that measured in its own rest frame).</p><p data-v-4b398fd6>As a result, from the inertial frame of the barn, the pole is moving at relativistic speeds and hence is therefore shorter and can thus fit into the barn comfortably.</p><p data-v-4b398fd6><img src="'+pt+'" style="width:5in;height:3.75in;" data-v-4b398fd6></p><p data-v-4b398fd6>However, from the inertial frame of the pole, the barn is moving at relativistic speeds, and hence contracts, making it even less able to fit into the barn.</p><p data-v-4b398fd6><img src="'+mt+'" style="width:5in;height:3.75in;" data-v-4b398fd6></p><p data-v-4b398fd6>How can it be that the ladder fits within the barn to one observer but not the other?</p><p data-v-4b398fd6>This may seem like a cursory glance that there is a paradox, yet there is an easy explanation to all of this. It lies in the concept of the relativity of simultaneity. What <em data-v-4b398fd6>exactly</em> do we mean by “the pole fitting inside of the barn”? Let us define it as that the right side of the pole is to the left of the right door of the barn, what we will call condition 1 and the left side of the pole is to the right of the left door of the barn, what we will call condition 2, at the same time, I.e. simultaneously.</p><p data-v-4b398fd6>This is partially also because time is relative to each frame of reference.</p><p data-v-4b398fd6>In the reference frame of the barn, the two conditions occur at the same time, whereas in the reference frame of the pole, condition 1 happens first in the absence of condition 2, then neither condition are fulfilled, afterwards condition 2 occurs in the absence of condition 1. (This can also be seen later using a Minkowski diagram, but we will have to wait for the video to see that later).</p><h2 data-v-4b398fd6>Terell Rotation</h2><p data-v-4b398fd6>Imagine one is travelling at a significant speed with respect to light and observes a stationary cube.</p><p data-v-4b398fd6>Now, one would expect that due to the Lorentz Transformations as elaborated above, there would be a contraction of the cube along the axis which one is travelling.</p><img width="256" alt="Animated Terrell Rotation - Cube" src="'+ft+'" data-v-4b398fd6><p data-v-4b398fd6>However, due to differences in the perception of the back of cubes and the front of the cubes, there is indeed an apparent rotation that one may notice whilst observing the cube.</p><p data-v-4b398fd6>Let us try to explain this phenomenon. The following image is of the motion of the observer and of the cube from above.</p><p data-v-4b398fd6><img src="'+wt+'" style="width:3.11458in;height:2.60417in;" data-v-4b398fd6></p><p data-v-4b398fd6>Now, one would expect that the light from the back of the cube, in this case D and C would be emitted first, than the light from the front of the cube, at A and B. Specifically, it would have to have travelled a further distance <em data-v-4b398fd6>l,</em> the length of a side of the cube, than the light coming from A or B.</p><p data-v-4b398fd6><img src="'+vt+'" style="width:3.20833in;height:2.86458in;" data-v-4b398fd6></p><p data-v-4b398fd6>Thus, when applying relativity, the observer would have simultaneously seen the earlier image of the back side of the cube, D’, and a later image of the front side of the cube A. This causes it to appear to have rotated horizontally.</p><p data-v-4b398fd6>We must remember that according to Einstein’s first postulate that the laws of physics must be identical in all inertial frames, hence this Terrell rotation must be a purely visual effect – and has no real world implications on the state of the cube itself.</p><p data-v-4b398fd6>This is the famous rotation that Terell and Penrose had both independently proposed in 1959. An interesting fact of this is that it taken a long time for physicists to realise that such an effect indeed took place, even 45 years Einstein had proposed Special Relativity.</p><p data-v-4b398fd6>This shows us that we should always try to fact-check our presumptions in certain contexts, as we may always find new and interesting phenomena just lurking beneath physical theories.</p><p style="text-align:right;" data-v-4b398fd6> (1052 words) </p>',39);var bt=(0,i.aZ)({__name:"ParadoxesChapter",setup(e){return(e,t)=>((0,i.wg)(),(0,i.iD)("div",gt,[yt,(0,i.Wm)(I,{"prev-chapter":"applications","next-chapter":"quiz"})]))}});const _t=(0,s.Z)(bt,[["__scopeId","data-v-4b398fd6"]]);var zt=_t,At=a(7139);const kt=e=>((0,i.dD)("data-v-039464ac"),e=e(),(0,i.Cn)(),e),Mt={class:"menu"},Zt=kt((()=>(0,i._)("h3",null,"Chapters",-1)));var xt=(0,i.aZ)({__name:"NavBar",setup(e){const t=(0,c.yj)();return(e,a)=>{const n=(0,i.up)("router-link");return(0,i.wg)(),(0,i.iD)("div",Mt,[Zt,(0,i.Wm)(n,{class:(0,At.C_)({active:"introduction"===(0,u.SU)(t).query.chapter}),to:"/article?chapter=introduction"},{default:(0,i.w5)((()=>[(0,i.Uk)(" Introduction ")])),_:1},8,["class"]),(0,i.Wm)(n,{class:(0,At.C_)({active:"applications"===(0,u.SU)(t).query.chapter}),to:"/article?chapter=applications"},{default:(0,i.w5)((()=>[(0,i.Uk)(" Applications ")])),_:1},8,["class"]),(0,i.Wm)(n,{class:(0,At.C_)({active:"paradoxes"===(0,u.SU)(t).query.chapter}),to:"/article?chapter=paradoxes"},{default:(0,i.w5)((()=>[(0,i.Uk)(" Paradoxes ")])),_:1},8,["class"]),(0,i.Wm)(n,{class:(0,At.C_)({active:"/quiz"===(0,u.SU)(t).path}),to:"/quiz"},{default:(0,i.w5)((()=>[(0,i.Uk)(" Quiz ")])),_:1},8,["class"])])}}});const Dt=(0,s.Z)(xt,[["__scopeId","data-v-039464ac"]]);var Tt=Dt;const Ct=e=>((0,i.dD)("data-v-0fbf6886"),e=e(),(0,i.Cn)(),e),Ut={class:"article-container"},qt=Ct((()=>(0,i._)("div",{class:"divider"},null,-1)));var jt=(0,i.aZ)({__name:"ArticleView",setup(e){const t=(0,c.yj)();return(e,a)=>((0,i.wg)(),(0,i.iD)("div",Ut,[(0,i.Wm)(Tt),(0,i._)("div",null,[(0,i.Wm)(n.uT,{name:"fade"},{default:(0,i.w5)((()=>["introduction"===(0,u.SU)(t).query.chapter?((0,i.wg)(),(0,i.j4)(ce,{key:0})):"applications"===(0,u.SU)(t).query.chapter?((0,i.wg)(),(0,i.j4)(ht,{key:1})):"paradoxes"===(0,u.SU)(t).query.chapter?((0,i.wg)(),(0,i.j4)(zt,{key:2})):(0,i.kq)("",!0)])),_:1})]),qt]))}});const Pt=(0,s.Z)(jt,[["__scopeId","data-v-0fbf6886"]]);var Wt=Pt;const Kt={key:0,class:"material-symbols-outlined"},It={class:"text"},St={key:0,class:"correct-answer-message"};var Jt=(0,i.aZ)({__name:"QuestionOption",props:{text:String,isSelected:Boolean,showIsCorrectAnswer:Boolean},setup(e){const t=e;return(e,a)=>((0,i.wg)(),(0,i.iD)("div",{class:(0,At.C_)(["option-container",{"show-is-correct-answer":t.showIsCorrectAnswer}]),onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=t=>e.$emit("select"))},[(0,i._)("div",{class:(0,At.C_)(["checkbox",{checked:t.isSelected}])},[t.isSelected?((0,i.wg)(),(0,i.iD)("div",Kt," check_small ")):(0,i.kq)("",!0)],2),(0,i._)("div",It,(0,At.zw)(t.text),1),t.showIsCorrectAnswer?((0,i.wg)(),(0,i.iD)("span",St,"Correct answer")):(0,i.kq)("",!0)],2))}});const Gt=(0,s.Z)(Jt,[["__scopeId","data-v-1f12c2b0"]]);var Nt=Gt;const Ot=e=>((0,i.dD)("data-v-15db0eac"),e=e(),(0,i.Cn)(),e),Bt={class:"quiz-container"},Et=Ot((()=>(0,i._)("div",{class:"divider"},null,-1))),Ft={key:0,class:"main"},Lt=Ot((()=>(0,i._)("h1",null,"Quiz",-1))),Qt={class:"qnum-container"},Yt={class:"bar"},Ht={class:"question-text"},Rt={class:"bottom"},Xt=Ot((()=>(0,i._)("div",{class:"material-symbols-outlined"},"check",-1))),Vt=Ot((()=>(0,i._)("div",{class:"material-symbols-outlined"},"close",-1))),$t=Ot((()=>(0,i._)("div",{class:"spacer"},null,-1))),ea={key:0,class:"material-symbols-outlined"},ta={key:1,class:"main results-container"},aa=Ot((()=>(0,i._)("h1",null,"Results",-1))),na=Ot((()=>(0,i._)("div",{class:"material-symbols-outlined"},"restart_alt",-1))),ia=[na];var oa=(0,i.aZ)({__name:"QuizView",setup(e){const t=(0,c.tv)(),a=(0,u.iH)(0),n=(0,u.iH)(null),o=(0,u.iH)(!1),s=(0,u.iH)(0),r=[{text:"What led to Einstein to reject the theory of Luminiferous Aether?",options:["He didn't think some substance could permeate the environment undetected","He felt that light was too fast to have to be mediated by some substance","The concept of a massless photon meant that its passage did not require a medium","The null result of the Michelson-Morley Experiment"],answer:3},{text:"A cube with sides of length 1m is moving with one of its sides parallel to the x-axis of an inertial frame S with velocity 0.5c.
